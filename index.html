							Webpages are not intended to seem similar in any way, form or fashion to 
							one another, nevertheless, they all tend to share some rather similar standard components,
							like a header and a footer, the main navigation menu used by all visitors
							to navigate the site, the main section where the content is typically 
							showcased. And, even sidebars are part of the basic anatomy of a website.
							The following table illustrates the sections of the anatomy of a website, 
							the HTML elements and their syntax along with some very basic information 
							that may help piece things together.
